I'm a evolutionary geneticist working to apply genomics and population genetic theory to conservation and management questions. I'm interested in how patterns of population structure change over time and space, and in figuring out the best ways to detect and validate those patterns.

Though I am originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, I have had the pleasure of living and doing science with amazing people in 7+ states/countries.

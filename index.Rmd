### Welcome

Hello! I am currently an NSF Postdoctoral Scholar at University of California, Santa Cruz. I'm working in the [Global Change Research Group](https://globalchange.sites.ucsc.edu/) to learn about evolutionary resiliency of giant kelp to it's rapidly changing environment.  I completed my PhD at Michigan State University working with Drs. [Gideon Bradburd](http://www.genescape.org/)
 and [Sarah Fitzpatrick](http://swfitz.com/). I received my master's with [Dr. Jeanne Robertson](https://jrobertsonlab.wordpress.com/) at California State University Northridge. I study small populations, and how they have persisted in the face of anthropogenic changes.
